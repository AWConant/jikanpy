Jikanpy
=======

Jikanpy is a Python wrapper for [Jikan](https://github.com/jikan-me/jikan),
providing bindings for all API functionality. Because it is intended to be
pretty much identical, please consult [Jikan's
documentation](https://jikan.me/) for thornier details on how it is meant to
be used. Perhaps most importantly, Jikanpy does not make any attempts to rate
limit itself, so use it as responsibly as you would use the API primitively.
