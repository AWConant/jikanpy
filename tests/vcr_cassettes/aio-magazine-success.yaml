        in the future has a massive over-population problem. Scientists have traced
        the root of this problem to one particular individual, Junta Monamari. According
        to their records, Junta was a \"Mega-Playboy\" who sired children with over
        a hundred women. Each one of his sons inherited the Mega-Playboy gene too,
        so the problem grew exponentially from thereon.\r\n\r\nMeet Karin Aoi, a \"DNA
        Operator.\" Karin is sent back to the past with a mission: to alter Junta''s
        DNA and prevent him from ever becoming the Mega-Playboy, thereby eliminating
        the world''s overpopulation problem. Junta''s DNA can only be altered by shooting
        him with a special bullet called DCM which contains the chemical for suppressing
        the Mega-Playboy DNA. In return, Karin gets a vast sum of money... enough
        to make all her dreams come true. Will Junta become the playboy he is destined
        to be, or will his better self prevail? But Karin is falling for the real
        Junta too... and what of the sweet and kindly Ami who has secretly loved Junta
        all her life? What will happen to future Japan?\r\n\r\n(Source: Manganews)","type":"Manga","publishing_start":"1993-08-09T00:00:00+00:00","volumes":5,"members":5669,"genres":[{"mal_id":27,"type":"manga","name":"Shounen","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/manga\/genre\/27\/Shounen"},{"mal_id":4,"type":"manga","name":"Comedy","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/manga\/genre\/4\/Comedy"},{"mal_id":24,"type":"manga","name":"Sci-Fi","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/manga\/genre\/24\/Sci-Fi"},{"mal_id":22,"type":"manga","name":"Romance","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/manga\/genre\/22\/Romance"}],"authors":[{"mal_id":2563,"type":"people","name":"Katsura,
