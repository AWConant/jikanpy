        Battousai has abandoned his bloodstained lifestyle in an effort to repent

        himself to protecting the weak. One day, he stumbles across Kaoru Kamiya at
        her kendo dojo, which is being threatened by an impostor claiming to be Battousai.
        After receiving help from Kenshin, Kaoru allows him to stay at the dojo, and

        the Norse god of mischief, has been exiled to the human world for what was
        apparently a bad joke. Along with being exiled, he''s forced to take the form
        of a child. He''s told the only way he can get back to the world of the gods
        is if he can collect auras of evil that take over human hearts, and so to
        do this he runs a detective agency. Loki is soon joined by a human girl named
        Mayura who is a maniac for mysteries, and she soon helps out in her own way.
        However, soon other Norse gods begin to appear, and most have the intent to
        assassinate Loki for reasons unclear. \n\n(Source: ANN) \n","type":"TV","airing_start":"2003-04-04T15:00:00+00:00","episodes":26,"members":29757,"genres":[{"mal_id":4,"type":"anime","name":"Comedy","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/4\/Comedy"},{"mal_id":16,"type":"anime","name":"Magic","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/16\/Magic"},{"mal_id":7,"type":"anime","name":"Mystery","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/7\/Mystery"},{"mal_id":27,"type":"anime","name":"Shounen","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/27\/Shounen"},{"mal_id":37,"type":"anime","name":"Supernatural","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/37\/Supernatural"}],"source":"Manga","producers":[{"mal_id":37,"type":"anime","name":"Studio
